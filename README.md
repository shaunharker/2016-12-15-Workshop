Shaun Harker

This Github repository contains materials for the workshop at Rutgers on 2016-12-15.

## Getting started with the code:

If you have `jupyter notebook`, try using it on the `.ipynb` files and see what is going on there. Also, check out the talk which gives examples.

You can also navigate to the `.ipynb` files on github and it will show you a non-interactive preview.
