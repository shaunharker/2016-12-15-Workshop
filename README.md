# 2016-12-15-Workshop

Shaun Harker

This Github repository contains materials for the workshop at Rutgers on 2016-12-15.

## What's in the repo:

There are two subfolders

* Talk
* Code

In `Talk` the images and html source of my talk are available.
In `Code` the codes used to give the demonstrations may be found.

## Getting started with the code:

If you have `jupyter notebook`, try using it on the `.ipynb` files and see what is going on there. Also, check out the talk which gives examples.

You can also navigate to the `.ipynb` files on github and it will show you a non-interactive preview.
